Helpers are classes that are not part of the core system but can greatly improve it by adding new features and possibilities.

This section documents the included helpers and how to use them. Since helpers are classes they can be added to the framework by placing them inside the helpers folder or in subfolders.

All helpers will have a namespace of `Nova\Helpers;`
